# WaitstaffSimulator
Second attempt at creating an accurate waiter simulation
This game is my attempt at encapsulating the experience of being a waiter in a restaurant.
My first attempt, Dan Never Leaves, was a very good learning experience, 
but when I tried to return to update that game after a few months away from it, the code felt fragmented and daunting.
So this project will (hopefully) be more clean and modular when it comes to scripting. 
I created a features list spreadsheet to hopefully organize the development of this game, which is attached to this repo...somewhere.
